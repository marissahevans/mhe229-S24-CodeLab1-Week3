# Homework project for weeks 1, 2 & 3 

This is a 3D game where the player (teal ball) navigates a maze and collects items (pink capsules) using WASD controls. Points are awarded as a linear combination between maximum points and time elapsed between targets. The more time elapsed the fewer points are earned. 

Scene 1 - maze elevated on a platform with a camera shift to phase two of the maze, a ramp with obsticals and more collectables. 

Scene 2 - roll around on flat ground to collect cylindars.
